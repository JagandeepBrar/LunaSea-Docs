# Android Keystore

In order to create production builds for LunaSea, you must first create and sign the release using the [Android Keystore System](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore).

## Create a Keystore

Open a terminal window and run the following command to generate a new Android keystore:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias lunasea
```
{% endcode %}

You can optionally change the following:

1. `-keystore ~/key.jks`: By default this will create the new keystore in the home directory of the running user as the file `key.jks` but this can be changed to any location you like
2. `-alias lunasea`: By default the keystore internal alias is set to `lunasea` but you can use any alias you like

The generation will ask you for some basic information including a password. **Please ensure you do not forget this password because you will need it in the next step**.

## Add the Keystore Information to LunaSea

In the root of the project, enter the `android` folder and copy your previously generated `*.jks` keystone into this folder, and name it `key.jks`.

In the same folder, open `key.properties.sample`. Fill in all of the fields with the following information:

1. `storePassword`: Password from step 1
2. `keyPassword`: Same password from step 1
3. `keyAlias`: The chosen alias from step 1
4. `storeFile`: Keep it as `../key.jks`

Save the file as `key.properties` inside of `<project root>/android`.

And that's it! You are ready to create production releases of LunaSea using your own signing keystore.
