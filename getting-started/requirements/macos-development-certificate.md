# macOS Development Certificate

In order to create any builds for LunaSea, you must first create and attach a [Development Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/) to the XCode project.

## Preparing the Project

&#x20;In the root of the project, enter the `macos` folder and open `Runner.xcworkspace` in XCode.

1. Select `Runner` in the lefthand navigation pane
2. Under `Targets` select `Runner`
3. Select the `Signing & Capabilities` tab

## Creating a Signing Team

1. Under `Signing` select the dropdown for the team (Should currently be `Unknown Name (<<My Team ID>>)`
2. Add an account (your Apple ID) and select your name or if already added then simply select your name
3. The status should show `Failed to register bundle identifier` because the bundle identifier needs to be unique for each profile

## Creating a Bundle Identifier and Signing Profile

1. Enter a **unique** bundle identifier (this does not need to resemble the current bundle identifier, it can be anything you want, but should follow the format of `<word>.<word>.<word>`, so for example I have used `app.lunasea.testprofile`
2. Once you enter a unique bundle identifier, hit "Try again" to fetch a new signing profile for this bundle identifier. You will see the `Apple Development: <Your email>` if you successfully created a signing profile

And that's it! You are ready to create builds of LunaSea using your own signing profile.
