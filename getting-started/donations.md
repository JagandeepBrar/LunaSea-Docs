# Donations

Thanks for considering donating to LunaSea! Donations are what keep the project alive and completely free for everyone to use.

## In-App Purchases

If you have downloaded LunaSea through the Play Store or App Store, you can directly donate using in-app purchases! Simply head to the Settings and tap the "Donations" tile. There are four options available (all scaled to USD): **$0.99, $2.99, $4.99, and $9.99**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using TestFlight builds on iOS devices, you will need to switch to the App Store version to donate. Any in-app purchases executed on a TestFlight build do not actually get processed.
{% endhint %}

## Ko-Fi

I have setup a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/jagandeepbrar) for LunaSea!

Ko-Fi allows you to make a one-time donation in $1 increments using PayPal.

## GitHub Sponsors

I have setup a [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JagandeepBrar) account!

GitHub Sponsors allow you to setup a recurring donation in the amount of $1 to $5.
